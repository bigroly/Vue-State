## Vue State App
My first go at using Vuex for app-level state management.

This builds on the previous app I created, again using the super simple use-case of a To-do list, but this time adding Vuex to manage component state at an app level, rather than passing props up and down the component chain.

Functions in this app are pretty simple:
* Create a new to-do
* Read a list of to-dos
* Filter the list of todos returned from API
* Update the state of a to-do
* Delete a to-do

Once again following Brad Traversy's YouTube tutorials which I would highly recommend if you want to get a better idea of how this works.
